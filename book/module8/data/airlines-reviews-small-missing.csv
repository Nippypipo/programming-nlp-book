Bangkok Airways,6,Economy,TRUE,March 2019,"For this flight I was connecting from a flight from London and when originally booked there was an over 3 hour transit time, however Bangkok Airways then cancelled this flight and we were booked on an earlier flight with only a 70 minute connection time. Our flight from London arrived late due to the Pakistan airspace restrictions and although we were met by a lady from Bangkok Airways and rushed across the airport we did not make the connection as the lady was not able to use any pressure to expedite the delay at transit immigration at security. However Bangkok Airways did get us on the later flight and the 4 hours in their lounge at BKK was ok! Once on board the A320 was quite tired and the seat cushions past their best. The flight arrived on time and they managed to serve a hot drink and a pastry in the 1 hour duration. In spite of the missed connection our luggage arrived on the flight so this was good!"
Bangkok Airways,9,Economy,TRUE,June 2019,"Bangkok to Koh Samui. Easy Check-In, The Bangkok Lounge (available to everyone) was crowded but still comfortable and the food and refreshments options plus WiFi are a bonus. Boarded on time via a bus, but was organized and efficient. Plane left bang on time and flight was 50 mins, in this time 4 crew still managed to serve a small hot lunch with hot beverages. Aircraft was clean comfortable but quite old. There is nothing not to like about Bangkok Airways, arriving in Koh Samui bags were out in 5 mins."
Bangkok Airways,,,FALSE,November 2021,"I just want to thank Bangkok Airways for their time and accommodations with my flight (which was booked by agent without understanding of the specific requirements for the flights in Thailand during the pandemic) especially the manager on arrival who helped me a lot to change my flight (unfortunately I didn’t ask his name). I didn’t get the same service from Aeroflot and particularly from Finnair. The manager went toward me and helped me to change my flight for the right one, if all airlines will be working like that it will be easier to fly, specially at present time during pandemic (which already makes tourism very difficult for passengers). Besides that, everything in airport was very good organized and done for the people on arrival not like in Europe."
Bangkok Airways,9,Economy,FALSE,April 2020,"I especially want to thank Khun Guy at Krabi Airport Ticketing Office for her perseverance and commitment as a ground handling Staff with Bangkok Airways where she gave me extreme assistance. She's a true dedicated employee. I was booked from Krabi to Bkk & connecting SQ979 to S'pore on April 5th, I realized on the day before my departure, Bangkok Airways was grounded and not taking off to Bkk and I went directly to KBV Airport on April 5th early morning hoping to book a ThaiSmile flight to BKK which was departing at 4pm that same April 5th. Somehow, with sheer luck I managed to get a seat with the kind help of Guy knowing that ThaiSmile was also fully booked and that I'm on their 1st priority list. At the same time,  Guy also made sure that I'm checked in with ThaiSmile as I need to be in Bangkok to connect my SQ flight back home to S'pore. Simultaneously she also made arrangements for Bangkok Airways Staff at Suvarnabhumi Airport to assist me for check-in with SIA knowing that it was a time-factor that I needed to check-in ASAP as my SQ Departure time was 6.30pm & ThaiSmile arrival Bkk at 5.30pm as I had to clear Customs & Immigration that will consume some time. Overall I made it for my SQ-979 check-in on time with the help of Bangkok Airways Staff at Suvarnabhumi Airport."
Garuda Indonesia,1,Eco,TRUE,July 2023,"Flew on GA-682 Jakarta to Sorong. I was able to check in at the SKY Priority desk and I was quickly escorted by the Garuda PSA Team member Yudi through security and into the Lounge. Soft drinks and snacks were provided in the lounge and staff were very helpful. When it came time for boarding Yudi also escorted me to the aircraft. Thank you Yudi, much appreciated. The flight itself was an overnight flight and was quite full, however the cabin crew managed to serve a meal and soft drinks and overall, they were very helpful and engaging in the typical warm and friendly Garuda-Indonesia way. We arrived in Sorong on time, and it took approx. 15 minutes for my baggage to come out, considering that early morning in Soring is very busy as many airlines arrive with 30 minutes of each other I found this a very acceptable time to wait. Overall, another good flight on Garuda-Indonesia."
Garuda Indonesia,9,Business,TRUE,,"Jakarta to Sorong. Check in was straight forward and quick as was the security. I was escorted from the check-in through to the lounge by the Ms Rosma the Garuda ground support manager and one of her team. When time came for boarding I greeted at the aircraft door with a warm welcome and a smile. We pulled back from the gate a little ahead of schedule, however we had a long taxi ride to the runway. Shortly after take-off the main meal was served. The choice was two Asian rice dishes only with a choice of soft or warm drinks. I opted for a only bread roll. More hot & cold drinks and snacks were served throughout the 3.40 hour flight. 30 minutes prior to landing in Sorong a bread roll was offered together with hot or cold drinks. Throughout the flight the toilets were cleaned and the cabin crew were very attentive through the flight. There were only two cabin crew in the business class section, which was full, however they provided a very good level of service and they were very polite and courteous. We landed in Sorong on schedule, however I had to wait nearly 45 minutes for my baggage."
Garuda Indonesia,9,Business,TRUE,February 2020,"Flew Jakarta-Sorong on GA862 the overnight flight. The check-in process was fast and efficient as was the security check. The lounge was quiet as it was late evening, however snacks and soft drinks were available in several area's within the lounge. The Boarding process was controlled and the cabin crew gave a very warm welcome upon boarding. We pulled back from the gate on schedule, however we had a long taxi to the runway, however that did not impact the arrival time in Sorong. Once airborne the cabin crew offered a selection of meals, however I opted for a sandwich. Prior to landing in the cabin crew again offered snacks and warm and cold drinks. Baggage was delivered very promptly i.e. approx. 5 minutes after arrival. Overall great flight."
Philippine Airlines,8,,TRUE,April 2023,"This was the second flight in 7 days with this airline. They are excellent to fly with. First flight was Brisbane to Manila then the second being Boracay to Clarke. The Brisbane to Manila really surprised me. Excellent service, good food, entertainment, and comfortable seats in economy. It did look like business class had flat beds even though seat guru said they were only recliners. I will certainly fly them again."
Philippine Airlines,7,Premium Economy,FALSE,January 2023,Got Premium economy since they were the only available seats going to Manila. The seats are premium and comfortable for the less than 2 hour flight. Food service was so so.
Philippine Airlines,11,Economy,TRUE,July 2023,"Miserable experience: very expensive, online booking guides you to purchase 20kg allowance when it is included already. Asked for refund, no help. Never again"
